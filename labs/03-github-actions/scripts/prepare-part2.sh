# Prepare Part 2 — set the shipped answer aside and drop in a starter skeleton.
#
# Part 2 has you REBUILD the workflow from scratch. GitHub only reads workflows
# from the repo root, so it lives at .github/workflows/lab03-ci.yml up there,
# not inside this lab folder. This script does only the two mechanical bits, so
# you can get straight to the interesting work:
#   1. moves the finished lab03-ci.yml out to this lab's .github/ci-reference.yml
#      (your answer key)
#   2. writes a bare two-job skeleton to .github/workflows/lab03-ci.yml (repo
#      root) for you to flesh out
#
# It does NOT write the real steps — the TODOs in the skeleton are yours to fill
# in across Part 2, steps 0-3. Every action is announced as it happens.
#
# Re-running is safe: if the answer is already set aside, it won't clobber anything.
