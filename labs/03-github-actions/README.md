# Lab 03: GitHub Actions

Day 2 of the [CI/CD for Ignition Masterclass](../../README.md).

> Build a CI safety net around a real Ignition project: run linters that catch problems before they ship, write a GitHub Actions workflow yourself, make it a required check on `main`, and see when to reach for a self-hosted runner.

The subject is the same **Ignition project** you worked on in
[Lab 02](../02-branching-and-prs/): a Perspective HMI screen (the Oatmakers Site 04
oat-line overview) and a couple of Python script libraries, running on a local gateway you
spin up yourself. Lab 02 had you run the checks **by hand**; this lab makes them
**automatic**: a required status check no one can merge past.

The repo tracks only the **project files**; the gateway generates its own config on boot
into a Docker volume we never commit. How those project files are structured, and how to
deploy them, is [Lab 04](../04-ignition-file-based-deploy/).

The offline copy is the same deck: open it from your clone if the link doesn't load.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Lab 02](../02-branching-and-prs/)
- Passed the [preflight](../../preflight/)
- Docker (with the Compose V2 plugin); about 1.5 GB RAM for the single gateway
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to create the linters' Python 3.12 venv (the same version CI uses; uv downloads it if needed)
- The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`), authenticated (`gh auth status`)

> **WSL2 (Windows): keep the clone in your Linux home (`~/…`), never `/mnt/c/…`.**
> `scripts/setup.sh` refuses to run from there, and never needs `sudo`.
> See [`docs/wsl-setup.md`](./docs/wsl-setup.md).

## Quick start

With your clone open in VS Code, from its terminal:

```bash
cd labs/03-github-actions        # from the root of your clone
(cd ../02-branching-and-prs && scripts/teardown.sh)   # Lab 02's gateway holds port 8088
cp .env.example .env
scripts/setup.sh        # boots one Ignition gateway, waits for RUNNING, prints the URL + login
# open http://localhost:8088  → log in with the .env credentials
```

Port 8088 taken by something else? Set `GATEWAY_PORT` in `.env` (for example
`GATEWAY_PORT=8090`) and re-run `scripts/setup.sh`; it prints the matching URL.

Install the linters and run the checks CI runs: see Setup and Part 1 in
[`exercises/lab.md`](./exercises/lab.md).

Stop the gateway when you're done:

```bash
scripts/teardown.sh             # stop (keeps the gateway's data volume)
scripts/teardown.sh --volumes   # stop and wipe gateway state for a fresh start
```

## Lab structure

The whole lab is one continuous workshop in [`exercises/lab.md`](./exercises/lab.md):

| Part | Topic |
|---|---|
| 1 | Linters as your safety net (yamllint, shellcheck, actionlint, **iglint**, `validate.sh`) |
| 2 | GitHub Actions: build `lab03-ci.yml` and a ruleset that requires it |
| 3 | Self-hosted runners: a discussion and an optional hands-on |

Part 1 starts from a deliberately broken state seeded by [`scripts/seed.sh`](./scripts/seed.sh).

This lab's workflows live at the **repo root**, the only place GitHub reads them:

```
.github/workflows/
├── lab03-ci.yml                       ← the workflow you rebuild in Part 2
└── lab03-runner-demo.yml              ← Part 3's self-hosted runner demo
```

## The Compose stack

A single Ignition 8.3 gateway:

- **The gateway's own config and runtime state live in a named volume** (`ignition-data`)
  that the gateway generates on first boot. It never lands in the repo.
- **`./projects` is bind-mounted** from the repo into the gateway, so the project files you
  and CI check are the files the gateway runs. (`./third-party-modules` is mounted too, read
  at boot: it holds the Project Scan Endpoint module that the Flint extension calls, as in
  Lab 02.)

```yaml
services:
  ignition:
    image: inductiveautomation/ignition:8.3.8
    ports: ["${GATEWAY_PORT:-8088}:8088"]                  # host port from .env
    volumes:
      - ignition-data:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data        # gateway-owned, self-generated, not in git
      - ./projects:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data/projects   # the one thing you edit
      - ./third-party-modules:/third-party-modules         # add-on .modl files, installed at boot

volumes:
  ignition-data:
```

> The gateway writes a `.resources/` blob store and other operational files inside
> `projects/` as it runs. They are gitignored; if you see them in `git status`, your ignore
> rules are off.
